## Week 1: Jan. 11-15

* Project planning
    + Reading literature 
    + Detailed rotation project outline 

## Week 2: Microscope set-up training
### Jan 17 
* Aligning the laser 
    + prism in front of diode laser
    + lens 
        - focal length
        - collimated beam of light (parallel rays in beam) vs. converging to a focus 
            - collimated: focused at infinity; place lens focal length distance away from source
            - if collimated light enter a lens, it focuses one focal length distance away 
        - confocal vs widefield setup 
        - adding magnification 

### Jan 18 
* Aligning the laser continued
    + adding mirrors to direct beam into microscope
    + adjusting mirrors to center light path and make beam symmetric 
    + using irises to check along light path
    + checking backscatter of light for each lens in path
    + added filters to path 
* Drummond lab meeting: Jared's research
* Squires lab meeting: Kyle's research proposal/interests

### Jan 19 
* Setting up the camera
  + added Kohler lens for widefield microscopy
  + directed light from microscope side port into camera 
  + detected blinking from Sharpie-marked coverslips
* Meeting with Allan and Allison about my rotation project outline/research plans 
  
### Jan 20
* Setting up the camera
  + readjust Kohler lens and lens paths to camera, readjust camera 
* Imaged Ranchi ruler to get pixel size  
* Learned how to use plasma etcher to clean glass slides
* Calculations
  + calculating Raleigh scattering and filters needed to attenuate power
  + calculating Raman scattering 

### Jan 21
* Used UV-Vis to take absorbance data on filters 
    + longpass, emission
    + bandpass
    + excitation

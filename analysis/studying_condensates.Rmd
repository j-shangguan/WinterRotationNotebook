* In eukaryotic cells, macromolecules are spatially and temporally organized to carry out certain biochemical processes
* Phase separated bodies are dynamic, interconnected molecular networks
    + Homotypic interactions: between polymers of the same type 
    + Heterotypic interactions: between polymers of different types
* Light microscopy: visualizing macromolecular phase separation/membrane-less bodies in vitro and in cells
    + Using contrast-based imaging methods like phase contrast or differential interference contrast(DIC) are used because it does not require fluorophores
        - Takes advantage of differences in refractive index and thickness within sample, changing phase of diffracted light --> diffracted lights is converted into intensity differences --> dense region is dark vs. light background 
        - Sample fixation may alter molecular dynamics of condensate and change epitope accessibility
    + Using FRAP to study dynamics of fluorescently-labeled components inside phase separated bodies
        - Illuminate specific area with high intensity laser to convert fluorophores to dark state
        - Unbleached and photobleached molecules move in and out of area 
        - Measure variation in fluorescence intensity over time (fluorescence recovery time)
            - Molecules can diffuse at several ms, so need a fast microscope to detect molecules
      + Super res
          - STORM: XY of 10-20 nm resolution and axial resolutions of 10-75 nm, temporal resolution of s to min

* Condensates have links to molecular mechanisms of disease 
    + e.g. impaired stress granules contribute to the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
* Liquid-liquid phase separation
    + Proteins/nucleic acids condense into dense phase --> looks like liquid droplets
    + Occurs when it is energetically favorable for macromolecule/water interactions to turn into macromolecule/macromolecule and water/water interactions 
    + Factors of concentrations and identities of macromolecules and solution and environment (salt, temperature, pH, etc) affect if phase separation will occur
    + LLPS can generate assemblies that are either liquids, solids or gels (different material properties)
        - Liquid: long-range molecule disorder, short-range arrangement (first layer of molecules) is regular 
    + Condensed phases usually reversible as triggered by an environmental change that causes dissolving 
* Techniques
    + In vitro reconstitution of cellular structure via LLPS with purified components 
        - Spherical droplets would indicate assembly formation via LLPS
    + Light microscopy
        - Image solution for liquid droplets 
        - Need to control for incubation time and imaging conditions 
        - Concern: some RNAs and RNA-bindng proteins could be crosslinked by light
    + Turbidity measurements 
        - Assemblies scatter visible light --> detect light scattering by optical density measurements or direct static light scattering 
        - Concern: does not provide information about the shape or size of assembly 
    + Centrifugation 
        - Light and dense phases will separate --> measure concentration of each spectroscopically 
        - Concern: cannot tell if aggregation or fibrillization is occurring rather than LLPS
* Just because a protein phase separates does not mean there is functional relevance
    + Can introduce defects in LLPS and see if there are defects in protein function
* Functions of LLPS
    + Sensing
        - Fast, adaptive and reversible responses to stress
    + Locally concentrate molecules for signaling processes, accelerating reactions, or nucleating cytoskeleton
    + Sequester molecules to inactivate or prevent reaction
    + Sort molecules to other sites/organelles/condensates

* Phase separation: 2 solutions separate into 2 states
* Multivalency drives LLPS: molecules assemble via inter and intramolecular interactions that have a lowered solubility limit --> demix with surrounding solution
    + Protein has multiple binding sites that promote phase separation
    + Intrinsic disordered sequences promote phase transition
*FRAP is used to look at molecules within liquid droplets
    + Tracking inside condensed phase 
    + Tracking exchange between condensed and diluted phases

* Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules = assemblies made of RNAs and proteins 
* Stress granules are a type of cytoplasmic RNP granules
    + Form during stress response (e.g. heat shock, oxidative stress, nutrient starvation/glucose deprivation)
        - Stress inhibits bulk translation initiation --> most mRNAs released from ribosomes
            - Some nontranslating mRNAs go into stress granules
        - Stress granule formation improves cell viability during stress
* Disease implications of stress granules
    + Stress granule formation can enhance immune response to dsRNA viral infections
    + Stress granule formation/disassembly mutations can progress degenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral scleorosis 
* Methods to identify proteins in stress granules
    + Immunofluorescence/tagging with fluor. protein
    + Purify stress granules, then mass spec
    + APEX proximity labeling (proximity-based proteomics)
* Methods to identify RNAs in stress granules
    + FISH
    + Purify stress granules, then RNA-seq
    + Pellet stress granuels, then RNA-seq
* Imaging approaches show that the internal ultrastructure of stress granules
    + Stress granule cores (G3BP1, Pab1, mRNAs) surrounded by regions of low density (Jain et al. 2016)
    + G3BP1 and IMP1 have restrained movement in ~150-200 nm regions of stress granules (Niewidok et al. 2018)

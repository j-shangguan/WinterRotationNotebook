### Goals of my rotation project:

* Understanding formation and function of biomolecular condensates
* Investigating and visualizing protein organization within heat shock-induced condensates
* Learning imaging approaches to probe the specificity of assembly of heat shock-induced condensates; training will include microscope set-up, protein labeling and potential single-molecule imaging techniques

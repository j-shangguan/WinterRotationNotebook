### Welcome to my winter quarter rotation documentation website.

**Here are general misc. notes and information relevant to this project:** [background info](notes.html)

**Here are helpful articles and notes to get background info:** [literature review](literature.html)

**Here are my experimental plans**: [plans](nextsteps.html)

**This is what I'm up to:** [activity log](dailylog.html)

**Data:** (set up webpage)

**Goals of my rotation project:**

* Understanding formation and function of biomolecular condensates
* Investigating and visualizing protein organization within heat shock-induced condensates
* Learning imaging approaches to probe the specificity of assembly of heat shock-induced condensates; training will include microscope set-up, protein labeling and potential single-molecule imaging techniques
